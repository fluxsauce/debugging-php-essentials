# Debugging PHP Advanced Techniques

Debug your PHP code effectively using a variety of client and server-side tools. Author Jon Peck demonstrates how to leverage Xdebug, Firebug, FirePHP, and others to improve the quality of your code and reduce troubleshooting overhead.

This course covers installation of Xdebug on Apache web servers and integration the NetBeans IDE. Then, a survey of web browser developer tools across Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer, including browser agnostic solutions such as Firebug Lite.

The next time an issue needs to be addressed, a full toolkit of options will be available!
